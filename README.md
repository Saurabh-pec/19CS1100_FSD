### Spring MVC CRUD Application
Spring MVC CRUD Application with MySQL and Hibernate. This project gives an idea about how to create Spring MVC Full Application having Model, Controller and View binded together to perform CRUD operations with Database connection using Hibernate Classes.

### jpa-maven
JPA is used to persist data between Java object and relational database. JPA acts as a bridge between object-oriented domain models and relational database systems.
### Prerequisites
 You are required to have few tools before you start with using the source code.

- JDK 1.8
- Maven
- IDE (Recommended - eclipse)

Install JDK, Maven and Git as first step, before you get the the code base setup.

### Setup Code Base


- Build a Project using Maven Project.
- Manages Dependencies - Web Layer (Spring MVC), Data Layer (JPA - Hibernate) etc..
